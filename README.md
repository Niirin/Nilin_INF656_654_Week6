This repository is a typing test project prototype (front-end wise) implemented using design principles of a PWA using MaterializeCSS. Simultaneously, this project encapsulates a simple user activity logging program implemented using simple Javascript and NodeJs's event loop and allowing the log to be saved into a file.

``` bash
node server.js
```
## Features
- Feature 1: UI prototype for a typing game website

- Feature 3: Countdown while the user types according to the displayed quotes and show the errors, accuracy, and WPM once the time runs out.
- Feature 4: Allows user activity logging to display on console log and saved into file for monitoring website traffic.

- MaterializeCSS
- Google Material Icons

Modules used in this NodeJS user logger activity include:
- fs : file system
- readline: to get user input

## Contributors
This project's main contributor is Nilin Lay and in consultation with the Nodejs and MaterializeCSS official documentation, GeeksorGeeks's tutorial on JavaScript typing game, as well as the guidance from FHSU professor Ramsey Muuva.
